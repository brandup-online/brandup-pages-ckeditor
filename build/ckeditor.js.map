Module duplication leads to inevitable runtime\n\t * errors.\n\t *\n\t * There are many situations in which some modules can be loaded twice. In the worst case scenario,\n\t * you may need to check your project for each of these issues and fix them all.\n\t *\n\t * # Trying to add a plugin to an existing build\n\t *\n\t * If you import an existing CKEditor 5 build and a plugin like this:\n\t *\n\t *\t\timport ClassicEditor from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-classic';\n\t *\t\timport Highlight from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-highlight/src/highlight';\n\t *\n\t * Then your project loads some CKEditor 5 packages twice. How does it happen?\n\t *\n\t * The build package contains a file which is already compiled with webpack. This means\n\t * that it contains all the necessary code from e.g. `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine` and `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-utils`.\n\t *\n\t * However, the `Highlight` plugin imports some of the modules from these packages, too. If you ask webpack to\n\t * build such a project, you will end up with the modules being included (and run) twice &mdash; first, because they are\n\t * included inside the build package, and second, because they are required by the `Highlight` plugin.\n\t *\n\t * Therefore, **you must never add plugins to an existing build** unless your plugin has no dependencies.\n\t *\n\t * Adding plugins to a build is done by taking the source version of this build (so, before it was built with webpack)\n\t * and adding plugins there. In this situation, webpack will know that it only needs to load each plugin once.\n\t *\n\t * Read more in the {@glink builds/guides/integration/installing-plugins \"Installing plugins\"} guide.\n\t *\n\t * # Confused an editor build with an editor implementation\n\t *\n\t * This scenario is very similar to the previous one, but has a different origin.\n\t *\n\t * Let's assume that you wanted to use CKEditor 5 from source, as explained in the\n\t * {@glink builds/guides/integration/advanced-setup#scenario-2-building-from-source \"Building from source\"} section\n\t * or in the {@glink framework/guides/quick-start \"Quick start\"} guide of CKEditor 5 Framework.\n\t *\n\t * The correct way to do so is to import an editor and plugins and run them together like this:\n\t *\n\t *\t\timport ClassicEditor from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-editor-classic/src/classiceditor';\n\t *\t\timport Essentials from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-essentials/src/essentials';\n\t *\t\timport Paragraph from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-paragraph/src/paragraph';\n\t *\t\timport Bold from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-basic-styles/src/bold';\n\t *\t\timport Italic from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-basic-styles/src/italic';\n\t *\n\t *\t\tClassicEditor\n\t *\t\t\t.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {\n\t *\t\t\t\tplugins: [ Essentials, Paragraph, Bold, Italic ],\n\t *\t\t\t\ttoolbar: [ 'bold', 'italic' ]\n\t *\t\t\t} )\n\t *\t\t\t.then( editor => {\n\t *\t\t\t\tconsole.log( 'Editor was initialized', editor );\n\t *\t\t\t} )\n\t *\t\t\t.catch( error => {\n\t *\t\t\t\tconsole.error( error.stack );\n\t *\t\t\t} );\n\t *\n\t * However, you might have mistakenly imported a build instead of the source `ClassicEditor`. In this case\n\t * your imports will look like this:\n\t *\n\t *\t\timport ClassicEditor from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-classic';\n\t *\t\timport Essentials from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-essentials/src/essentials';\n\t *\t\timport Paragraph from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-paragraph/src/paragraph';\n\t *\t\timport Bold from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-basic-styles/src/bold';\n\t *\t\timport Italic from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-basic-styles/src/italic';\n\t *\n\t * This creates the same situation as in the previous section because you use a build together with source plugins.\n\t *\n\t * Remember: `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-*` packages contain editor builds and `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-editor-*` contain source editors.\n\t *\n\t * # Loading two or more builds on one page\n\t *\n\t * If you use CKEditor 5 builds, you might have loaded two (or more) `ckeditor.js` files on one web page.\n\t * Check your web page for duplicated `<script>` elements or make sure your page builder/bundler includes CKEditor only once.\n\t *\n\t * If you want to use two different types of editors at once, see the\n\t * {@glink builds/guides/integration/advanced-setup#scenario-3-using-two-different-editors \"Using two different editors\"}\n\t * section.\n\t *\n\t * # Using outdated packages\n\t *\n\t * Building CKEditor 5 from source requires using multiple npm packages. These packages have their dependencies\n\t * to other packages. If you use the latest version of, for example, `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-editor-classic` with\n\t * an outdated version of `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image`, npm or yarn will need to install two different versions of\n\t * `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-core` because `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-editor-classic` and `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image` may require\n\t * different versions of the core package.\n\t *\n\t * The solution to this issue is to update all packages to their latest version. We recommend\n\t * using tools like [`node-check-updates`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates) which simplify this process.\n\t *\n\t * # Conflicting version of dependencies\n\t *\n\t * This is a special case of the previous scenario. If you use CKEditor 5 with some third-party plugins,\n\t * it may happen that even if you use the latest versions of the official packages and the latest version of\n\t * these third-party packages, there will be a conflict between some of their dependencies.\n\t *\n\t * Such a problem can be resolved by either downgrading CKEditor 5 packages (which we do not recommend) or\n\t * asking the author of the third-party package to upgrade its depdendencies (or forking their project and doing this yourself).\n\t *\n\t * **Note:** All official CKEditor 5 packages (excluding integrations and `ckeditor5-dev-*` packages) are released in the\n\t * same major version. This is &mdash; in the `x.y.z`, the `x` is the same for all packages. This is the simplest way to check\n\t * whether you use packages coming from the same CKEditor 5 version. You can read more about versioning in the\n\t * {@glink framework/guides/support/versioning-policy Versioning policy} guide.\n\t *\n\t * # Packages were duplicated in `node_modules`\n\t *\n\t * In some situations, especially when calling `npm install` multiple times, it may happen\n\t * that npm will not correctly \"deduplicate\" packages.\n\t *\n\t * Normally, npm deduplicates all packages so, for example, `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-core` is installed only once in `node_modules/`.\n\t * However, it is known to fail to do so from time to time.\n\t *\n\t * We recommend checking if any of the steps listed below help:\n\t *\n\t * * `rm -rf node_modules && npm install` to make sure you have a clean `node_modules/` directory. This step\n\t * is known to help in most cases.\n\t * * If you use `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json`, remove it before `npm install`.\n\t * * Check whether all CKEditor 5 packages are up to date and reinstall them\n\t * if you changed anything (`rm -rf node_modules && npm install`).\n\t *\n\t * If all packages are correct and compatible with each other, the steps above are known to help. If not, you may\n\t * try to check with `npm ls` how many times packages like `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-core`, `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine` and\n\t *`@ckeditor/ckeditor5-utils` are installed.

Because of it, we need to fill all\n * empty elements which should be selectable with elements or characters called \"fillers\". Unfortunately there is no one\n * universal filler, this is why two types are uses:\n *\n * * Block filler is an element which fill block elements, like `<p>`. CKEditor uses `<br>` as a block filler during the editing,\n * as browsers do natively. So instead of an empty `<p>` there will be `<p><br></p>`. The advantage of block filler is that\n * it is transparent for the selection, so when the caret is before the `<br>` and user presses right arrow he will be\n * moved to the next paragraph, not after the `<br>`. The disadvantage is that it breaks a block, so it can not be used\n * in the middle of a line of text. The {@link module:engine/view/filler~BR_FILLER `<br>` filler} can be replaced with any other\n * character in the data output, for instance {@link module:engine/view/filler~NBSP_FILLER non-breaking space}.\n *\n * * Inline filler is a filler which does not break a line of text, so it can be used inside the text, for instance in the empty\n * `<b>` surrendered by text: `foo<b></b>bar`, if we want to put the caret there. CKEditor uses a sequence of the zero-width\n * spaces as an {@link module:engine/view/filler~INLINE_FILLER inline filler} having the predetermined\n * {@link module:engine/view/filler~INLINE_FILLER_LENGTH length}. A sequence is used, instead of a single character to\n * avoid treating random zero-width spaces as the inline filler. Disadvantage of the inline filler is that it is not\n * transparent for the selection. The arrow key moves the caret between zero-width spaces characters, so the additional\n * code is needed to handle the caret.\n *\n * Both inline and block fillers are handled by the {@link module:engine/view/renderer~Renderer renderer} and are not present in the\n * view.\n *\n * @module engine/view/filler\n */\n\n/**\n * Non-breaking space filler creator.

Callbacks listening to those events are called converters. Those\n * converters role is to convert the model changes to changes in view (for example, adding view nodes or\n * changing attributes on view elements).\n *\n * During conversion process, `DowncastDispatcher` fires events, basing on state of the model and prepares\n * data for those events. It is important to understand that those events are connected with changes done on model,\n * for example: \"node has been inserted\" or \"attribute has changed\". This is in a contrary to upcasting (view to model conversion),\n * where we convert view state (view nodes) to a model tree.\n *\n * The events are prepared basing on a diff created by {@link module:engine/model/differ~Differ Differ}, which buffers them\n * and then passes to `DowncastDispatcher` as a diff between old model state and new model state.\n *\n * Note, that because changes are converted there is a need to have a mapping between model structure and view structure.\n * To map positions and elements during downcast (model to view conversion) use {@link module:engine/conversion/mapper~Mapper}.\n *\n * `DowncastDispatcher` fires following events for model tree changes:\n *\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:insert insert}\n * if a range of nodes has been inserted to the model tree,\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:remove remove}\n * if a range of nodes has been removed from the model tree,\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:attribute attribute}\n * if attribute has been added, changed or removed from a model node.\n *\n * For {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:insert insert}\n * and {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:attribute attribute},\n * `DowncastDispatcher` generates {@link module:engine/conversion/modelconsumable~ModelConsumable consumables}.\n * These are used to have a control over which changes has been already consumed. It is useful when some converters\n * overwrite other or converts multiple changes (for example converts insertion of an element and also converts that\n * element's attributes during insertion).\n *\n * Additionally, `DowncastDispatcher` fires events for {@link module:engine/model/markercollection~Marker marker} changes:\n *\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:addMarker} if a marker has been added,\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:removeMarker} if a marker has been removed.\n *\n * Note, that changing a marker is done through removing the marker from the old range, and adding on the new range,\n * so both those events are fired.\n *\n * Finally, `DowncastDispatcher` also handles firing events for {@link module:engine/model/selection model selection}\n * conversion:\n *\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:selection}\n * which converts selection from model to view,\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:attribute}\n * which is fired for every selection attribute,\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:addMarker}\n * which is fired for every marker which contains selection.\n *\n * Unlike model tree and markers, events for selection are not fired for changes but for selection state.\n *\n * When providing custom listeners for `DowncastDispatcher` remember to check whether given change has not been\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/modelconsumable~ModelConsumable#consume consumed} yet.\n *\n * When providing custom listeners for `DowncastDispatcher` keep in mind that any callback that had\n * {@link

In contrary to {@link module:engine/model/node~Node nodes}, which are building blocks of\n * model document tree, markers are not stored directly in document tree but in\n * {@link module:engine/model/model~Model#markers model markers' collection}. Still, they are document data, by giving\n * additional meaning to the part of a model document between marker start and marker end.\n *\n * In this sense, markers are similar to adding and converting attributes on nodes. The difference is that attribute is\n * connected with a given node (e.g. a character is bold no matter if it gets moved or content around it changes).\n * Markers on the other hand are continuous ranges and are characterized by their start and end position. This means that\n * any character in the marker is marked by the marker. For example, if a character is moved outside of marker it stops being\n * \"special\" and the marker is shrunk. Similarly, when a character is moved into the marker from other place in document\n * model, it starts being \"special\" and the marker is enlarged.\n *\n * Another upside of markers is that finding marked part of document is fast and easy. Using attributes to mark some nodes\n * and then trying to find that part of document would require traversing whole document tree. Marker gives instant access\n * to the range which it is marking at the moment.\n *\n * Markers are built from a name and a range.\n *\n * Range of the marker is updated automatically when document changes, using\n * {@link module:engine/model/liverange~LiveRange live range} mechanism.\n *\n * Name is used to group and identify markers. Names have to be unique, but markers can be grouped by\n * using common prefixes, separated with `:`, for example: `user:john` or `search:3`. That's useful in term of creating\n * namespaces for custom elements (e.g. comments, highlights). You can use this prefixes in\n * {@link module:engine/model/markercollection~MarkerCollection#event:update} listeners to listen on changes in a group of markers.\n * For instance: `model.markers.on( 'update:user', callback );` will be called whenever any `user:*` markers changes.\n *\n * There are two types of markers.\n *\n * 1. Markers managed directly, without using operations. They are added directly by {@link module:engine/model/writer~Writer}\n * to the {@link module:engine/model/markercollection~MarkerCollection} without any additional mechanism.

Currently, the supported modifications are:\n *\n * * Extending. The selection focus is moved in the specified `options.direction` with a step specified in `options.unit`.\n * Possible values for `unit` are:\n *  * `'character'` (default) - moves selection by one user-perceived character. In most cases this means moving by one\n *  character in `String` sense. However, unicode also defines \"combing marks\". These are special symbols, that combines\n *  with a symbol before it (\"base character\") to create one user-perceived character. For example, `q̣̇` is a normal\n *  letter `q` with two \"combining marks\": upper dot (`Ux0307`) and lower dot (`Ux0323`). For most actions, i.e. extending\n *  selection by one position, it is correct to include both \"base character\" and all of it's \"combining marks\". That is\n *  why `'character'` value is most natural and common method of modifying selection.\n *  * `'codePoint'` - moves selection by one unicode code point. In contrary to, `'character'` unit, this will insert\n *  selection between \"base character\" and \"combining mark\", because \"combining marks\" have their own unicode code points.\n *  However, for technical reasons, unicode code points with values above `UxFFFF` are represented in native `String` by\n *  two characters, called \"surrogate pairs\". Halves of \"surrogate pairs\" have a meaning only when placed next to each other.\n *  For example `𨭎` is represented in `String` by `\\uD862\\uDF4E`. Both `\\uD862` and `\\uDF4E` do not have any meaning\n *  outside the pair (are rendered as ? when alone). Position between them would be incorrect.

When the visible view is removed from the stack,\n * the previous view becomes visible.\n *\n * It might be useful to implement nested navigation in a balloon. For instance, a toolbar view may contain a link button.\n * When you click it, a link view (which lets you set the URL) is created and put on top of the toolbar view, so the link panel\n * is displayed. When you finish editing the link and close (remove) the link view, the toolbar view is visible again.\n *\n * However, there are cases when there are multiple independent balloons to be displayed, for instance, if the selection\n * is inside two inline comments at the same time. For such cases, you can create two independent panel stacks.\n * The contextual balloon plugin will create a navigation bar to let the users switch between these panel stacks using the \"Next\"\n * and \"Previous\" buttons.\n *\n * If there are no views in the current stack, the balloon panel will try to switch to the next stack. If there are no\n * panels in any stack, the balloon panel will be hidden.\n *\n * **Note**: To force the balloon panel to show only one view, even if there are other stacks, use the `singleViewMode=true` option\n * when {@link module:ui/panel/balloon/contextualballoon~ContextualBalloon#add adding} a view to a panel.\n *\n * From the implementation point of view, the contextual ballon plugin is reusing a single\n * {@link module:ui/panel/balloon/balloonpanelview~BalloonPanelView} instance to display multiple contextual balloon\n * panels in the editor. It also creates a special {@link module:ui/panel/balloon/contextualballoon~RotatorView rotator view},\n * used to manage multiple panel stacks. Rotator view is a child of the balloon panel view and the parent of the specific\n * view you want to display. If there is more than one panel stack to be displayed, the rotator view will add a\n * navigation bar. If there is only one stack, the rotator view is transparent (it does not add any UI elements).\n *\n * @extends module:core/plugin~Plugin\n */\nexport default class ContextualBalloon extends Plugin {\n\t/**\n\t * @inheritDoc\n\t */\n\tstatic get pluginName() {\n\t\treturn 'ContextualBalloon';\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * @inheritDoc\n\t */\n\tconstructor( editor ) {\n\t\tsuper( editor );\n\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * The {@link module:utils/dom/position~Options#limiter position limiter}\n\t\t * for the {@link #view balloon}, used when no `limiter` has been passed into {@link #add}\n\t\t * or {@link #updatePosition}.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * By default, a function that obtains the farthest DOM\n\t\t * {@link module:engine/view/rooteditableelement~RootEditableElement}\n\t\t * of the {@link module:engine/view/document~Document#selection}.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @member {module:utils/dom/position~Options#limiter} #positionLimiter\n\t\t */\n\t\tthis.positionLimiter = () => {\n\t\t\tconst view = this.editor.editing.view;\n\t\t\tconst viewDocument = view.document;\n\t\t\tconst editableElement = viewDocument.selection.editableElement;\n\n\t\t\tif ( editableElement ) {\n\t\t\t\treturn view.domConverter.mapViewToDom( editableElement.root );\n\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\treturn null;\n\t\t};\n\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * The currently visible view or `null` when there are no views in any stack.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @readonly\n\t\t * @observable\n\t\t * @member {module:ui/view~View|null} #visibleView\n\t\t */\n\t\tthis.set( 'visibleView', null );\n\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * The common balloon panel view.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @readonly\n\t\t * @member {module:ui/panel/balloon/balloonpanelview~BalloonPanelView} #view\n\t\t */\n\t\tthis.view = new BalloonPanelView( editor.locale );\n\t\teditor.ui.view.body.add( this.view );\n\t\teditor.ui.focusTracker.add( this.view.element );\n\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * The map of views and their stacks.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @private\n\t\t * @type {Map.<module:ui/view~View,Set>}\n\t\t */\n\t\tthis._viewToStack = new Map();\n\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * The map of IDs and stacks.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @private\n\t\t * @type {Map.<String,Set>}\n\t\t */\n\t\tthis._idToStack = new Map();\n\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * A total number of all stacks in the balloon.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @private\n\t\t * @readonly\n\t\t * @observable\n\t\t * @member {Number} #_numberOfStacks\n\t\t */\n\t\tthis.set( '_numberOfStacks', 0 );\n\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * A flag that controls the single view mode.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @private\n\t\t * @readonly\n\t\t * @observable\n\t\t * @member {Boolean} #_singleViewMode\n\t\t */\n\t\tthis.set( '_singleViewMode', false );\n\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * Rotator view embedded in the contextual balloon.\n\t\t * Displays the currently visible view in the balloon and provides navigation for switching stacks.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @private\n\t\t * @type {module:ui/panel/balloon/contextualballoon~RotatorView}\n\t\t */\n\t\tthis._rotatorView = this._createRotatorView();\n\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * Displays fake panels under the balloon panel view when multiple stacks are added to the balloon.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @private\n\t\t * @type {module:ui/view~View}\n\t\t */\n\t\tthis._fakePanelsView = this._createFakePanelsView();\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Returns `true` when the given view is in one of the stacks.

We have `operationsA` and `operationsB` array, which we dynamically update as the transformation process goes.\n\t//\n\t// 2. We take next (or first) operation from `operationsA` and check from which operation `b` we need to start transforming it.\n\t// All original `operationsA` are set to be transformed starting from the first operation `b`.\n\t//\n\t// 3. We take operations from `operationsB`, one by one, starting from the correct one, and transform operation `a`\n\t// by operation `b` (and vice versa). We update `operationsA` and `operationsB` by replacing the original operations\n\t// with the transformation results.\n\t//\n\t// 4. If operation is broken into multiple operations, we save all the new operations in the place of the\n\t// original operation.\n\t//\n\t// 5. Additionally, if operation `a` was broken, for the \"new\" operation, we remember from which operation `b` it should\n\t// be transformed by.\n\t//\n\t// 6. We continue transforming \"current\" operation `a` until it is transformed by all `operationsB`. Then, go to 2.\n\t// unless the last operation `a` was transformed.\n\t//\n\t// The actual implementation of the above algorithm is slightly different, as only one loop (while) is used.\n\t// The difference is that we have \"current\" `a` operation to transform and we store the index of the next `b` operation\n\t// to transform by. Each loop operates on two indexes then: index pointing to currently processed `a` operation and\n\t// index pointing to next `b` operation. Each loop is just one `a * b` + `b * a` transformation. After each loop\n\t// operation `b` index is updated. If all `b` operations were visited for the current `a` operation, we change\n\t// current `a` operation index to the next one.\n\t//\n\n\t// For each operation `a`, keeps information what is the index in `operationsB` from which the transformation should start.\n\tconst nextTransformIndex = new WeakMap();\n\n\t// For all the original `operationsA`, set that they should be transformed starting from the first of `operationsB`.\n\tfor ( const op of operationsA ) {\n\t\tnextTransformIndex.set( op, 0 );\n\t}\n\n\t// Additional data that is used for some postprocessing after the main transformation process is done.\n\tconst data = {\n\t\tnextBaseVersionA: operationsA[ operationsA.length - 1 ].baseVersion + 1,\n\t\tnextBaseVersionB: operationsB[ operationsB.length - 1 ].baseVersion + 1,\n\t\toriginalOperationsACount: operationsA.length,\n\t\toriginalOperationsBCount: operationsB.length\n\t};\n\n\t// Index of currently transformed operation `a`.\n\tlet i = 0;\n\n\t// While not all `operationsA` are transformed...\n\twhile ( i < operationsA.length ) {\n\t\t// Get \"current\" operation `a`.\n\t\tconst opA = operationsA[ i ];\n\n\t\t// For the \"current\" operation `a`, get the index of the next operation `b` to transform by.\n\t\tconst indexB = nextTransformIndex.get( opA );\n\n\t\t// If operation `a` was already transformed by every operation `b`, change \"current\" operation `a` to the next one.\n\t\tif ( indexB == operationsB.length ) {\n\t\t\ti++;\n\t\t\tcontinue;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tconst opB = operationsB[ indexB ];\n\n\t\t// Transform `a` by `b` and `b` by `a`.\n\t\tconst newOpsA = transform( opA, opB, contextFactory.getContext( opA, opB, true ) );\n\t\tconst newOpsB = transform( opB, opA, contextFactory.getContext( opB, opA, false ) );\n\t\t// As a result we get one or more `newOpsA` and one or more `newOpsB` operations.\n\n\t\t// Update contextual information about operations.\n\t\tcontextFactory.updateRelation( opA, opB );\n\n\t\tcontextFactory.setOriginalOperations( newOpsA, opA );\n\t\tcontextFactory.setOriginalOperations( newOpsB, opB );\n\n\t\t// For new `a` operations, update their index of the next operation `b` to transform them by.\n\t\t//\n\t\t// This is needed even if there was only one result (`a` was not broken) because that information is used\n\t\t// at the beginning of this loop every time.\n\t\tfor ( const newOpA of newOpsA ) {\n\t\t\t// Acknowledge, that operation `b` also might be broken into multiple operations.\n\t\t\t//\n\t\t\t// This is why we raise `indexB` not just by 1.

A batch is saved instead of the operation because changes are undone batch-by-batch, not operation-by-operation\n * and a batch is seen as one undo step.\n *\n * After some changes happen to the document, the `History` and `UndoCommand` stack can be represented as follows:\n *\n *\t\t    History                            Undo stack\n *\t\t==============             ==================================\n *\t\t[operation A1]                         [batch A]\n *\t\t[operation B1]                         [batch B]\n *\t\t[operation B2]                         [batch C]\n *\t\t[operation C1]\n *\t\t[operation C2]\n *\t\t[operation B3]\n *\t\t[operation C3]\n *\n * Where operations starting with the same letter are from same batch.\n *\n * Undoing a batch means that a set of operations which will reverse the effects of that batch needs to be generated.\n * For example, if a batch added several letters, undoing the batch should remove them. It is important to apply undoing\n * operations in the reversed order, so if a batch has operation `X`, `Y`, `Z`, reversed operations `Zr`, `Yr` and `Xr`\n * need to be applied. Otherwise reversed operation `Xr` would operate on a wrong document state, because operation `X`\n * does not know that operations `Y` and `Z` happened.\n *\n * After operations from an undone batch got {@link module:engine/model/operation/operation~Operation#getReversed reversed},\n * one needs to make sure if they are ready to be applied. In the scenario above, operation `C3` is the last operation and `C3r`\n * bases on up-to-date document state, so it can be applied to the document.\n *\n *\t\t     History                             Undo stack\n *\t\t=================             ==================================\n *\t\t[ operation A1  ]                      [  batch A  ]\n *\t\t[ operation B1  ]                      [  batch B  ]\n *\t\t[ operation B2  ]             [   processing undoing batch C   ]\n *\t\t[ operation C1  ]\n *\t\t[ operation C2  ]\n *\t\t[ operation B3  ]\n *\t\t[ operation C3  ]\n *\t\t[ operation C3r ]\n *\n * Next is operation `C2`, reversed to `C2r`. `C2r` bases on `C2`, so it bases on the wrong document state. It needs to be\n * transformed by operations from history that happened after it, so it \"knows\" about them. Let us assume that `C2' = C2r * B3 * C3 * C3r`,\n * where `*` means \"transformed by\". Rest of operations from that batch are processed in the same fashion.\n *\n *\t\t     History                             Undo stack                                      Redo stack\n *\t\t=================             ==================================             ==================================\n *\t\t[ operation A1  ]                      [  batch A  ]                                    [ batch Cr ]\n *\t\t[ operation B1  ]                      [  batch B  ]\n *\t\t[ operation B2  ]\n *\t\t[ operation C1  ]\n *\t\t[ operation C2  ]\n *\t\t[ operation B3  ]\n *\t\t[ operation C3  ]\n *\t\t[ operation C3r ]\n *\t\t[ operation C2' ]\n *\t\t[ operation C1' ]\n *\n * Selective undo works on the same basis, however, instead of undoing the last batch in the undo stack, any batch can be undone.\n * The same algorithm applies: operations from a batch (i.e. `A1`) are reversed and then transformed by operations stored in history.\n *\n * Redo also is very similar to undo.

But since in RTL the toolbar\n\t\t//    is attached on the right side and the positioning uses CSS \"left\", it will result in the toolbar shifting\n\t\t//    to the left and being displayed in the wrong place.\n\t\t// 2. (WRONG ❌) If the panelView.pin() is called first and #maxWidth set next, then basically the story repeats. The balloon\n\t\t//    calculates the position for the old toolbar grouping state, then the toolbar re-groups items and because\n\t\t//    it is positioned using CSS \"left\" it will move.\n\t\t// 3. (RIGHT ✅) We show the panel first (the toolbar does re-grouping but it does not matter), then the #maxWidth\n\t\t//    is set allowing the toolbar to re-group again and finally panelView.pin() does the positioning when the\n\t\t//    items grouping state is stable and final.\n\t\t//\n\t\t// https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6449, https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6575\n\t\tthis.panelView.show();\n\t\tthis.toolbarView.maxWidth = this._getToolbarMaxWidth();\n\n\t\tthis.panelView.pin( {\n\t\t\ttarget: this.buttonView.element,\n\t\t\tlimiter: this.editor.ui.getEditableElement()\n\t\t} );\n\n\t\tif ( !wasVisible ) {\n\t\t\tthis.toolbarView.items.get( 0 ).focus();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Hides the {@link #toolbarView}.\n\t *\n\t * @private\n\t * @param {Boolean} [focusEditable=false] When `true`, the editable will be focused after hiding the panel.\n\t */\n\t_hidePanel( focusEditable ) {\n\t\tthis.panelView.isVisible = false;\n\n\t\tif ( focusEditable ) {\n\t\t\tthis.editor.editing.view.focus();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Attaches the {@link #buttonView} to the target block of content.\n\t *\n\t * @protected\n\t * @param {HTMLElement} targetElement Target element.\n\t */\n\t_attachButtonToElement( targetElement ) {\n\t\tconst contentStyles = window.getComputedStyle( targetElement );\n\n\t\tconst editableRect = new Rect( this.editor.ui.getEditableElement() );\n\t\tconst contentPaddingTop = parseInt( contentStyles.paddingTop, 10 );\n\t\t// When line height is not an integer then thread it as \"normal\".\n\t\t// MDN says that 'normal' == ~1.2 on desktop browsers.\n\t\tconst contentLineHeight = parseInt( contentStyles.lineHeight, 10 ) || parseInt( contentStyles.fontSize, 10 ) * 1.2;\n\n\t\tconst position = getOptimalPosition( {\n\t\t\telement: this.buttonView.element,\n\t\t\ttarget: targetElement,\n\t\t\tpositions: [\n\t\t\t\t( contentRect, buttonRect ) => {\n\t\t\t\t\tlet left;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( this.editor.locale.uiLanguageDirection === 'ltr' ) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleft = editableRect.left - buttonRect.width;\n\t\t\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleft = editableRect.right;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\treturn {\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttop: contentRect.top + contentPaddingTop + ( contentLineHeight - buttonRect.height ) / 2,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleft\n\t\t\t\t\t};\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t} );\n\n\t\tthis.buttonView.top = position.top;\n\t\tthis.buttonView.left = position.left;\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Gets the {@link #toolbarView} max-width, based on\n\t * editable width plus distance between farthest edge of the {@link #buttonView} and the editable.\n\t *\n\t * @private\n\t * @returns {String} maxWidth A maximum width that toolbar can have, in pixels.\n\t */\n\t_getToolbarMaxWidth() {\n\t\tconst editableElement = this.editor.ui.view.editable.element;\n\t\tconst editableRect = new Rect( editableElement );\n\t\tconst buttonRect = new Rect( this.buttonView.element );\n\t\tconst isRTL = this.editor.locale.uiLanguageDirection === 'rtl';\n\t\tconst offset = isRTL ?
